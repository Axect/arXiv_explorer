# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
national origin, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open and welcoming
environment, and to demonstrate an empathy and regard for our fellow community
members.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members who may be less experienced
  than you
* Being considerate of those who may not be as familiar with the conventions
  used in our community
* Learning from and being open to constructive feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions in a way that respects this community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project leaders.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by contacting
axect.tg@proton.me.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Harmful Conduct

1.1. **Severity Levels**:

* **1.0 - Minor**: Verbal or written comments that are considered slight but
  hurtful or exclusionary. Minor offenses are those that are part of a pattern
  of behavior or that would reasonably cause others to feel uncomfortable.

* **2.0 - Significant**: Verbal or written comments that are considered
  inappropriate, including those that are offensive or harmful. Significant
  offenses include the presence of mild-to-moderate sexual content (including
  references to sexual preferences or kinks, but not non-consensual sexual
  content) that would make others uncomfortable.

* **3.0 - Severe**: Actions that create hostile, threatening, or abusive
  environments. Severe offenses include the presence of explicit sexual content,
  hate speech, threats, or encouragement of self-harm.

1.2. **Consequences**:

* **Level 1.0**: A private note from a community leader expressing concern
  regarding the behavior and inviting the individual to discuss what changes
  they would like to make.

* **Level 2.0**: A private note from a community leader with an explanation of
  the unacceptable behavior, why it was unacceptable, and a request to
  communicate more respectfully and considerately. A community leader may also
  request the individual to stop engaging with the project until the issue is
  resolved.

* **Level 3.0**: Immediate, permanent exclusion from the project community and
  any associated events, with zero tolerance for repetition.

### 2. Unacceptable Conduct

* **Sexual Content**: Comments or content that are explicitly sexual, including
  detailed descriptions of sexual acts, genitalia, or sexual preferences and
  kinks, even when consensual.

* **Hate Speech**: Comments that target or dehumanize individuals based on
  characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, sex
  characteristics, gender identity, sexual orientation, or other protected
  status.

* **Harassment**: Verbal or written comments that are directed at an individual
  with the intent to annoy, intimidate, or demean, or that would reasonably
  cause a reasonable person to feel uncomfortable in the community.

* **Personal Attacks**: Offensive comments or actions that target individuals
  or groups based on their identity, beliefs, or affiliations.

* **Targeted Offenses**: Conduct targeted at specific individuals or groups,
  such as repeated harassment or exclusion of particular members of the
  community.

* **Unwelcome Physical Contact**: Any unwanted physical contact, including
  touching, hugging, or other forms of physical contact that make someone
  uncomfortable.

* **Incitement to Harm**: Encouraging others to engage in harmful behavior,
  including the promotion of illegal acts or violence.
